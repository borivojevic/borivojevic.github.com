As soon as I started working as a full time freelancer I decided it was a time to start writing a blog and to have basic portfolio website. I created one page website with just contact info in a matter of hours and put it online to serve me temporarily until I don't finish more content-rich website.

Six months later and countless of iterations I'm fully satisfied with the content I produced and it is finally ready to launch.

So why did it take so long to finish? Alongside regular consultancy work I had left only evenings and weekends to realy focus on my side project. Even though I was working really hard I had a lot to learn on many fronts like: writing website copy, web design, typography, making it look pretty in different browsers and handheld/mobile devices.

I spent a lot of time writing actual copy for website with a great help from Brennan Dunn and his excellent [The Blueprint book][] which merely influenced my messages.

On the technical side I decided to [blog like hacker][] and used Jekyll static site generator which also enabled me with free hosting via [Github Pages][] (Kudos for Github!). Source code is [hosted on Github] so feel free to take a look and steal bits of content it if you like it ;)

Thanks for reading and I hope I'll be publishing more useful content once in a while... if I ever get some free time!
