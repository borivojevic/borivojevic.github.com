I am so inspired by the world of photography - I enjoy watching photos and I enjoy taking them as well. However I'm not a photographer.

I've been looking to get a proper DSLR for some time, but let's face it, spending a lot of money will not make me a photographer, right? Any modern phone camera can capture respectable quality photos anyway.

Instead, I stick to my Nexus phone camera and capture my precious moments with a bit of Instagram magic. A huge plus is that I have it with me at almost all times.

So I keep reminding myself:
> The best camera is the one you have with you
