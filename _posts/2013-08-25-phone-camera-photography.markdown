Photography inspires me. I enjoy looking at professional photos and I enjoy taking photos as well. However I'm not as near as good as I would like to be.

I was considering to get a proper DSLR camera for some time, but let's face it, spending a lot of money on professional equipment ain't gonna make me a photographer, right? Any modern phone camera can capture respectable photos as well.

That's why I stick to my Nexus phone camera and capture my precious moments with a bit of Instagram magic. A huge plus is I have my phone with me at all times and it's so convenient to take it anywhere.

So I keep reminding myself:
> The best camera is the one you have with you
