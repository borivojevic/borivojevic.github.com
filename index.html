        <h6>My Background</h6>
        <p>I got my first payed job in 2007 in local web development agency during my master studies in Software Engineering, though I've stared learning programing almost 5 years earlier while I was still in high-school.<p>

        <p>I've finished my master thesis about <a href="https://github.com/borivojevic/final-thesys">context aware mobile web applications and user's content generation and collaboration</a> in 2011 on <a href="http://elfak.ni.ac.rs/en/">University of Nis, Serbia</a> and continued to work in local agencies for 5 years in total before taking a plunge in solo career.</p>

        <p>During that time I was  working on mid to large scale web applications, usually as a one-man-team and I learned how to cope with big projects alone.
        That gave me a challenge to increase my skills in other technical areas such as setting up production servers, deploying, monitoring and maintaining applications as well as non-technical skills like communicating requirements directly with clients, writing project proposals, writting technical specifications and estimates and managing software products development.</p>
        <p>Working and being managed remotely throughout almost whole my carer given me skills to communicate and collaborate effectively with remote teams.</p>
