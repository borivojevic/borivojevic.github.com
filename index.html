			<h1>Hiring A Developer Doesn't Need To Feel Like Pulling Teeth</h1>

			<p>Have your company already hired freelancers in the past? Did they understand you and your business? Did your project end up on time and on budget? I know exactly how you feel - not long ago I was clumsy freelancer too. However, over time I adopted few key aspects that helped me understand my clients better, deliver my services on time and make my clients happier.</p>

			<p>1. Programming is about communication as much it is about writing a great code. Good developers must know to recognize actual problems and to communicate requirements and business goals effectively before turning them into language of machines. My development process focuses on frequent and clear communication with clients in order to understand problems they have and help them define goals before we start figuring out the perfect solution.</p>

			<p>2. Writing clean, readable and testable code is one of my top priorities. Software developers spend only fraction of time writing code and majority of their time reading and maintaining it. Having great, maintainable code can save lot of time, effort and client's money in the long run.</p>

			<p>3. I take project management seriously and use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)">agile software management</a> techniques. We will start with working but incomplete prototype and continuously add features and refine it until you are fully satisfied. At any time I'll be able to answer you where are we on time and budget and what are we currently working on.</p>

			<h1>What people I enjoy working with say about me</h1>

			<p class="testimonial">"Mirko’s worked with us for over two years providing in depth insight to web based programming technologies such as CakePHP, JQuery, GIT, various API’s, and much more.  He’s able to quickly specify a project from either technical or business requirements, find or imagine solutions, and then implement those solutions chosen.  The programming foundations he lays are robust and extensible which is a great boon allowing us to work in an agile manner given ever changing business requirements.  I also look forward to continuing our work together given his consistently professional and positive demeanor."</p>

			<h1>My Story</h1>
			<p>I got my first paid job in 2007 in local web development agency although I started learning programing almost 5 years earlier while I was still in high-school.</p>

			<p>For next 5 years I was working on mid-to-large scale web applications, usually as a one-man-team and I learned how to cope with big projects alone. That gave me flexibility and challenge  to develop skills in other technical areas such as setting up production servers, deploying, monitoring and maintaining applications as well as non-technical areas like communicating requirements directly with clients, writing project proposals, writting technical specifications and estimates and managing software products development.</p>

			<p>Working and being managed remotely throughout almost whole my career gave me skills to communicate and collaborate effectively with remote teams.</p>

			<p class="hint">If you want to know more about my employment history take a look at my <a class="action" href="http://rs.linkedin.com/in/mirkoborivojevic/">LinkedIn profile</a>

			<p>I graduated in 2011 with a masters degree in Software Engineering from <a href="http://elfak.ni.ac.rs/en/">University of Nis</a> and in mid 2012 I decided to take a plunge in solo career.</p>

			<p>I'm 26, I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C5%A1">Niš, Serbia</a>, happy to have my family and friends living in same town. I enjoy my free time hanging out with my friends, girlfriend and my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/odie.beagle.nis">best buddy</a>. I love to <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12696973-mirko-borivojevic">read interesting books</a> and to play guitar occasionally.</p>

			<p>I have a couple of great clients far away from California, US and I am always seeking for new challenging projects.
