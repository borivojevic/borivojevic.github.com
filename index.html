			<h1>Hiring A Developer Doesn't Need To Feel Like Pulling Teeth</h1>

			<p>Have your company already hired freelancers in the past? Did they understand you and your business? Did your project end up on time and on budget? I know exactly how you feel - not long ago I was clumsy freelancer too. However, over time I adopted few key aspects that helped me understand my clients better, deliver my services on time and make my clents happier.</p>

			<p>1. Programming is about communication as much it is about writing a great code. Good developers needs to know how to recognize what the actual problem is and to communicate requirements and business goals before turning them into language of machines. My development process focuses on frequent and clear communication with clients in order to understand actual problems they have and help them define goals before we start figuring out the perfect solution.</p>

			<p>2. Writing clean, readable and testable code is one of my top priorities. Software developers spend only fraction of time writing code and majority of their time reading and maintaining it. Having great, maintainable code can save lot of time, effort and client's money in the long run.</p>

			<p>3. I take project management seriously and use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)">agile software management</a> techniques. We will start with working but incomplete prototype and continuously add features and refine it until you are satisfied. At any time I'll be able to answer where are we on time and budget and what are we currently working on.<p>

            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>I got my first payed job in 2007 in local web development agency although I stared learning programing almost 5 years earlier while I was still in high-school.<p>

            <p>For 5 years I was working on mid-to-large scale web applications, usually as a one-man-team and I learned how to cope with big projects alone. That gave me a challenge to increase my skills in other technical areas such as setting up production servers, deploying, monitoring and maintaining applications as well as non-technical skills like communicating requirements directly with clients, writing project proposals, writting technical specifications and estimates and managing software products development.</p>

            <p>Working and being managed remotely throughout almost whole my carer given me skills to communicate and collaborate effectively with remote teams.</p>

            <p>I graduated in 2011 with a masters degree in Software Engineering from <a href="http://elfak.ni.ac.rs/en/">University of Nis</a> and in mid 2012 I decided to taka a plunge in solo career.</p>
