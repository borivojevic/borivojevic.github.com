			<h1>My Work</h1>
			<p>Programming is about <b>communication</b> as much it is about <b>writing a code</b>. Good software developer needs to know how to recognize what the actual problem is, communicate requirements and business goals before turning them into language of machines. My development process focuses on <b>frequent and clear communication</b> with clients in order to <b>understand</b> which problems they have and help them <b>define goals</b> before we sit to the drawing board to design the actual solution.</p><br>

			<p>Secondly (but not less important) writing <b>clean</b>, <b>readable</b> and <b>testable</b> code comes to my list of priorities. Knowing that software developers spend only fraction of time writing code and majority of the time <b>reading</b> and <b>maintaining</b> it, clean code can save lot of time, effort and clients money in the long run.</p>

			<p>Finally I believe that hiring remote worker doesnâ€™t need to suck. Most of people have bad experiences by hiring freelancer and have their project fail.
			I lean to bridge that problem by taking project management seriously and using agile software management technologies that focus on maintaining functional application prototype at all times and adding more functionalities on top of it each week (called weekly sprints). Thus I'll always be prepaired to answer what are we currently working on, how much work do we have left and where are we on budget.<br>
			<p>

			<p>Did your company already developed sophisticated management processes? We can also work to have me integrated and managed just as any other organizational node.

            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>I got my first payed job in 2007 in local web development agency during my master studies in Software Engineering, though I've stared learning programing almost 5 years earlier while I was still in high-school.<p>

            <p>I've finished my master thesis about <a href="https://github.com/borivojevic/final-thesys">context aware mobile web applications and user's content generation and collaboration</a> in 2011 on <a href="http://elfak.ni.ac.rs/en/">University of Nis, Serbia</a> and continued to work in local agencies for 5 years in total before taking a plunge in solo career.</p>

            <p>During that time I was  working on mid to large scale web applications, usually as a one-man-team and I learned how to cope with big projects alone.
            That gave me a challenge to increase my skills in other technical areas such as setting up production servers, deploying, monitoring and maintaining applications as well as non-technical skills like communicating requirements directly with clients, writing project proposals, writting technical specifications and estimates and managing software products development.</p>
            <p>Working and being managed remotely throughout almost whole my carer given me skills to communicate and collaborate effectively with remote teams.</p>

            <p>As a solo developer I've been working with web development shops (mainly from SF Bay Area) on number of mid-large scale projects.
				<ul>
					<li>I've been part of a larger team working on major event booking / fund-raising system for well known organization.</li>
					<li>I've developed system for one of the America's largest medical handout providers.</li>
					<li>I've finished application for small startup aiming to make content shared on social networks more context aware and discoverable.</li>
				</ul>
