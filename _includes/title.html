            <p>

            <p>
                After years of practice and dozen of mid-to-large sized web project I adopted skills needed in different phases of software development process - like <b>planing</b>, <b>estimating</b>, <b>managing</b>, <b>developing</b>, <b>deploying</b> and finally <b>monitoring</b> and <b>maintaining</b> web applications and underlying software stack.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Today I’m fully focused on helping web development and design shops, statups and creative and interactive agencies by building custom web solutions. I'm currently <b>available for hire</b> and if you need highly skilled and reliable developer <a href="contact.html">let's schedule</a> a time to chat about your project and to get know each other better.
